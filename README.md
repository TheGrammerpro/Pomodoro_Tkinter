This is a time management productivity application.

Once the "Start" button is pressed, a countdown starts lasting 25 minutes. This is the time to work.

After the countdown reaches zero, a notification sound is played and a new countdown starts lasing 5 minutes. This is the time to rest.

The 25 minutes count down starts again and the loop continues until the fourth repition, where the break is 20 minutes long.

After the long break, the timer starts over with another four repitions until the next long break.

The "reset" button resets the timers, repitions and makes the "start" button clickable once again to start over.

This is inspired by the pomodoro time management technique developped by Francesco Cirillo.
